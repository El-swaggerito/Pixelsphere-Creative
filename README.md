## ‚ú® Features Implemented

### 1. Gradient/Glassy Navbar
- Fixed navbar at the top of every page.
- Uses a multi-layered gradient (radial orange/purple glows + blue linear gradient) with a glassy blur effect.
- White text and subtle shadow for readability.
- On the Work page, the navbar background is solid white with blue text for contrast.

### 2. Full-Width Dropdown Services Menu
- Services dropdown is full-width, flush under the navbar, and overlays the entire hero/content area.
- Dropdown uses the same gradient/glassy background as the hero and navbar for a seamless look.
- Responsive grid layout for service categories and links.
- Dropdown menu overlays the page with a semi-transparent black backdrop for focus.
- Closes on outside click or Escape key.
- Keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly.

### 3. Fixed Navbar with Content Padding
- All main content and hero sections have `pt-20` (padding-top) to ensure nothing is hidden behind the fixed navbar.
- Consistent spacing across all pages.

### 4. Hero Section Improvements
- Hero content is vertically spaced for visual balance.
- Decorative SVGs and background gradients for a modern look.
- Responsive typography and layout.

### 5. Social Media Icons in Footer
- Footer includes crisp, accessible icons for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (X), and LinkedIn using lucide-react.
- Each icon is ready to be linked to your real social media profiles.

### 6. Removal of Unwanted Overlays/Panels
- Online Status Overlay and Auto-Response Panel have been removed from the Contact page for a cleaner UI.

### 7. Work Page White Navbar
- The Work page uses a white navbar for a distinct, professional look.
- All other pages retain the gradient/glassy navbar.
